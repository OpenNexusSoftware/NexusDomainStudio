# Nexus Domain Studio

**Model your domains with confidence.**

Nexus Domain Studio is a cross-platform desktop application (built with .NET 8 and Avalonia UI) for designing and managing **domain-driven models**.  
It provides a structured way to capture **domains, bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects, and events**, all within a clean and intuitive interface.
